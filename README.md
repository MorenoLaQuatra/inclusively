# Inclusively demo

This repository contains the Flask application that powers the [Inclusively](#) platform demo.

## What is Inclusively?

Inclusively is a platform that aims at developing deep learning models that can detect and correct non-inclusive language.

It leverages an NLP pipeline that includes:

- **Detection**: Detecting non-inclusive language in a text.
- **Rewriting**: If some non-inclusive language is detected, the model will rewrite the text to make it inclusive.

## How does it work?

The platform is composed of 4 main pages:

- **Home**: The home page of the platform. It contains a brief description of the platform and a link to the demo.
- **Testing**: The testing page. It contains the demo itself and the possibility to insert the text to be corrected by Inclusively.
- **Evaluation**: The evaluation page. It allows users to evaluate the correctness of the corrections made by Inclusively. Each user can provide a feedback for each correction at sentence level.
- **Explaination**: The explaination page. It contains the output of explainability methods applied to the model. It can allow *data scientists* to understand how the model works and how it makes its decisions.
