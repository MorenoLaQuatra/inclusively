# Inclusively

Inclusively aims at creating deep learning models that can detect and correct non-inclusive language writing.

It leverages an NLP pipeline that includes:

- **Detection**: It detects non-inclusive language in the text using text classification techniques.
- **Rewriting**: If some non-inclusive language is detected, a sequence-to-sequence model is used to modify the text and suggest a more inclusive rewriting.

# Methodology and Models

Inclusively uses a two-stage deep learning pipeline designed to promote inclusive writing. The first stage employs a **classification model** based on transformer architectures to detect non-inclusive sentences. Once detected, the second stage activates a **sequence-to-sequence model**, which generates inclusive reformulations of the identified text. The platform also integrates feedback from expert users, allowing continuous model refinement through a human-in-the-loop approach. This system enables Inclusively to offer accurate and contextually appropriate rewrites while also promoting self-learning in inclusive writing practices.

# Demo

This repository also contains the Flask application that powers the [Inclusively](#) platform demo.
This demo has been accepted at [ECML PKDD 2023 - Demo Track](https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/).

## How does it work?

The platform is composed of 4 main pages:

- **Home**: The home page of the platform. It contains a brief description of the platform and a link to the demo.
- **Testing**: The testing page. It contains the demo itself and the possibility to insert the text to be corrected by Inclusively.
- **Evaluation**: The evaluation page. It allows users to evaluate the correctness of the corrections made by Inclusively. Each user can provide a feedback for each correction at sentence level.
- **Explanation**: The explanation page. It contains the output of explainability methods applied to the model. It can allow *data scientists* to understand how the model works and how it makes its decisions.
